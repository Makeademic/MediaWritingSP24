<h3>Introduction</h3>

						
								
<p>Hockey Lessons: Stickhandling Success On and Off the Field"I have played field hockey since 4th grade, which was about 12 years ago. I have a lot of experience and am extremely passionate about the sport. Playing field hockey requires dedication, perseverance and a passionate for the game. You must have dedication on and off the field. When I was younger, I would go to tournaments and weekend trips to play new teams and put myself out of my comfort zone. Every game was an opportunity to improve and become a better player.</p>

								<h3>Competition</h3>
								
<p>I am a very competitive person so playing field hockey fits my personality and competitive mindset. I am extremely drawn to the fast-paced action, the strategic depth, and the sense of community. Every sprint, every pass and every shot is a thrilling opportunity to outmaneuver opponents and win the game. Field hockey is a game of strategy and intellect. To be a great player, every move on the field is somewhat planned out and calculated. It is kind of like chess. You must be constantly engaged and challenged. You can try to outsmart the defender and try to always stay one step ahead.</p>
								
								<h3>Teamwork</h3>
								
								<p>Field hockey is a team sport. One of my favorite things about field hockey is my teammates and having fun together. Winning a game is all about the teamwork and effective communication, coordination, and collaboration among teammates. To outsmart the opposition, our team much work together to be aware of each other movemenets. In my 12 years of playing, when my team has s strong team dynamic and work well together, we play much better and have a much better outcome on the field. To create a good team dynamic it is important to be friends off the field as well. Some of my successful teams throughout the years would do team bonding activities off the field as well. Some activities include, getting food before or after game and practices, sleepovers, attending parties or just simply chatting about social lives. It is important to create those relationships and know exactly who your teammates are to create a good bond.</p>
								
								<h3>How to win</h3>
								
								<p>Many people might say there is no recipe for how to win a field hockey game, but I believe there are a few attributes and ingredients that make the game a lot easier to win. I believe a combination of skill, strategy, team, and determination are the biggest ingredients to win a field hockey game. Players must practice the little things to become a good player. The fundamentals like passing, catching, dribbling, and shooting are so crucial. A good defender must practice her way of attacking the offender and an offender must master her way of shooting with power and finesse to beat the defender and goalie. To master these fundamentals takes a lot of practice and time. The more time and effort you put in practice the fundamentals, the better a player you will be. Another crucial ingredient to winning a game is maintaining composure under pressure and staying disciplined. If a team is cocky or overly confident, they most likely will not play great. On the other hand, if the team is extremely nervous and not mentally prepared, they also most likely will not play great. Playing with good sportsmanship and good values, leads to victory on the field.</p>
								
								<h3>Real Life Connection</h3>
								
								<p>There are several lessons learned from playing field hockey that intertwined with real life. The challenges and successes can be related to real life in many ways. From navigating the complexities of the job market or academic setbacks, the determination taught by field hockey has pushed me despite the challenges. There are also so many values that I have learned from playing field hockey and helped teach team me to make ethical decisions.  It has taught me to be respectful and have good sportsmanship in my everyday life.</p>

								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								
								<p>In conclusion, I have learned a lot through my 12 years of field hockey. From the thrill of competition to the aspect of teamwork, the sport has made me into the person I am today. I have learned so many life lessons through being part of a team and believe it has shaped to become a better person. Playing field hockey taught me the fundamentals of maintaining composure under pressure, the culmination of skill, strategy, and unified teamwork. I work in teams and groups every day in school in and work and believe my ability to communicate and converse with groups all comes from field hockey. I am grateful for the lessons I learned, the memories I made, and the friendships I formed.</p>
