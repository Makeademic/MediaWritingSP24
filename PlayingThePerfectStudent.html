<h3>How to Balance Life and School</h3>
<p>To play the perfect student, you will have to juggle the difficulty of balancing school and extracurricular activities. An effective strategy I take to ensure I do well in school is putting it as a priority over all of my other responsibilities. I believe that to be a good student you need to prioritize self-care, which includes getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and exercising. When you don’t prioritize how you care for yourself it creates a poor impact on your academic performance. When analyzing my responsibilities I make sure to be realistic with myself and what I can get done. For example, if I have soccer practice tonight, but I also have a big test the next day I should stay home and study for my test.  To achieve the skill of balancing academics and extracurriculars requires good time management skills and being able to make conscious choices to allocate time appropriately.</p>
								
								<h3>Characteristics of a Successful Student</h3>
								
								<p>To fulfill the image of the perfect student, I need to demonstrate certain attributes. For me to do well in school I must attend every lecture and get they’re on time. According to studies, students like me who attend lectures on a daily routine benefit the most from their education. However, when I am absent, I make sure to take proactive steps such as asking my classmates or teacher for the notes I missed and to refresh me on what we learned while I was gone. As a top student, I make sure to be attentive in the classroom, participate, and provide knowledgeable ideas. Class participation not only enhances a better learning environment, but also encourages my personal growth by allowing me to voice my own opinions and ideas. To fit the requirements of the perfect student I must use different methods. One method is making sure I submit everything on time, doing extra credit, utilizing available resources such as office hours, and studying outside the classroom. Being the perfect student is more than getting just good grades and obeying the rules. It’s about going above and beyond what is asked and applying what I learned outside the classroom. By adopting this all-around approach to my education, I can do well in school and use what I learn in my everyday life. This way, I truly show what it means to be the perfect student. </p>
								
								<h3>Study Tips</h3>
								
								<p>For me to obtain the characteristics of a successful student, I must put in hard work to achieve good grades. To achieve these good grades, I have a list of study tactics I use. It is critical for me to view doing schoolwork in a positive light and see failure as a reason to work harder. Second, I must avoid cramming study time right before a test this can be prevented with good organizational skills. By creating a schedule ahead of time of destinated times I can study throughout the week that way I achieve full comprehension of the material. Third, I would recommend prioritizing planning ahead of time. This allows me to have more free time to study as well as provide balance in my schedule. While facing academic challenges I find it resourceful to seek support from my peers. Peer tutoring, office hours, and workshops are all resourceful in times when I am stressed. Collaborative study sessions that use a buddy system help encourage mutual accountability and support for me. When it comes to learning it is important to me that I am open to taking different approaches to educating myself as it helps improve how I think and my ability to retain information. Finally, I find that I get better grades when I create a study environment that suits my needs and also by implanting a reward system that helps to encourage my good study habits. Personally, I am most productive in a room with silence and no distractions this way the only thing that has my full attention is my schoolwork. Rewarding myself with ice-cream or watching my favorite TV show after studying helps me maintain a more positive outlook towards learning. Lastly, I found that the key to performing well on tests and solidifying my understanding is by consistently studying.</p>
								
								
								<h3>Time Management Tips</h3>
								
								<p>Being a student who wants to thrive academically has made me realize I need to have effective time management skills. One significant factor that contributes to my poor time management skills is my tendency to associate school with negative feelings which results in my procrastinating. For me to overcome this challenge, I must try different approaches to improve my ability to complete tasks for school promptly.</p>
								
     <p>Developing self-compassion is essential for me to have good time management skills. This includes recognizing and accepting that setbacks are a part of the learning process for me and making sure I take proper care of myself. Furthermore, cultivating a sense of curiosity will help boost my motivation which will help me have a positive outlook on getting tasks done.</p> 
     
								<p>It is important for me to make procrastination less enticing by removing distractions and creating an environment that promotes me to learn. Planning and breaking tasks down into smaller phases will help me stay organized and ensure that I meet all my deadlines.</p>
     <p>Using my time efficiently is crucial. Instead of draining myself by studying for long periods of time I study in shorter periods and allow for occasional breaks. This helps me stay productive but also allows me to have time to recuperate. Selecting tasks and focusing on one task at a time helps improve my productivity.</p>
     <p>I must maintain a positive and motivated mindset when managing my time. Seeing my failures as chances for growth and learning, while also still having confidence in my ability to complete tasks, are important parts that create a successful time management strategy. By using these approaches, I can take on my academic responsibilities with ease and confidence which make me the perfect student.</p>
