<h3><strong>Photo Play</strong></h3>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Going out to shoot with my camera is my version of playing. In particular, two of my favorite ways to play are at car meets, or out fishing. When going to car meets I specifically love to shoot the Porsche 911s. Over the past couple of years, I have fallen in love with these cars and dream of owning one. I’m able to play around with these cars and with my camera by shooting at different angles, and playing with different settings on my camera like the aperture and zoom.</span></p>
<p><span>When out fishing, I’m also able to play with my camera. I am able to get cool shots of the landscape, and sunrise or sunset depending on the time. Bringing my camera out fishing also allows me to get good quality pictures of the fish we catch. I want to start recording and taking more pictures as well to document the adventures and fish better.I hope to play with my camera more by taking more street photography shots and other landscape shots other than while I'm out fishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;Specs of The Canon EOS RP</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p><span>The Canon EOS RP has a 26.2-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor. This allows it to deliver excellent image quality with rich detail and dynamic range. This sensor size ensures superior low-light performance and beautiful background blur, making it suitable for various photography genres, including portraits, landscapes, and street photography.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The EOS RP body only is about one pound in weight and features a slim profile which makes it easy to bring out while playing. The EOS RP is one of the lightest and most portable full-frame cameras on the market. Its compact size makes it an ideal choice for photographers who value mobility and versatility without compromising on image quality.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;This Camera's mount is an RF mount. This mount is specifically designed for Mirrorless cameras. With the use of an adapter, the camera is compatible with Canon's extensive range of EF and EF-S lenses. If I had enough money this would allow me to play around with all different kinds of lenses. Make sure you take note of this when purchasing a lens. I mistakenly did not and had to get an RF to EF lens mount adapter for my lens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;While the EOS RP offers 4K video recording capabilities, it does come with some limitations compared to other cameras in its class. This camera records 4K video at 24 frames per second with a crop. This has some effect on my playing because I’d like to take 4k videos while we fish, but the 24 frames per second does not like fast moving actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lastly, the EOS RP has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. This enables seamless sharing of images and videos to my Iphone when I’m done playing. This feature also can act as remote camera control through Canon's Camera Connect app which I have yet to play with.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Why I Chose This Camera&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span>I chose to get this camera because of these specs and for its price point. For the body of the camera itself, it came out to around $1,000. Compared to other cameras this could be a lot worse on the bank account. I also chose to get the body brand new because when buying it refurbished, you don't know how the last person treated the camera. This being my first camera, it is a perfect beginner camera for me. After watching YouTube videos, and talking to my friends that know more about cameras, the Canon EOS RP was the best option for me to play with. I do wish it was a little better for video but for pictures, it works great.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Lens</strong></h3>
<p><span>The Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM A lens is tailored for mirrorless camera systems. This</span><span> versatile zoom lens offers exceptional image quality, rugged construction, and professional-grade performance. Its optical design uses high-quality glass elements, including aspherical, low dispersion, and high refractive index elements. This build effectively minimizes various optical blemishes like chromatic distortion, and spherical distortion, ensuring outstanding sharpness, clarity, and color accuracy throughout the zoom range.</span></p>
<p><span>With the highest aperture of f/2.8 across the entire zoom range, this lens works great playing in low-light conditions. The wide aperture also enables beautiful background blur, making it ideal for portraiture and selective focus applications.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This lens is also built to withstand the rigors of professional use. The lens features strong construction, with weather-sealing to protect against dust and moisture. The solid metal barrel and mount contribute to its durability and longevity. Its strong build allows for minor mistakes like minor drops and bumps while out playing.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why Sigma Lens</strong></p>
<p><span>I went with this lens because there were not many lenses to choose from. Just like camera bodies, the lenses are also expensive. If I was going to buy the same lens I have, just by Canon, it would have been $2,100. I paid $1,200 for my Sigma lens which is just as good of quality as the Canon lenses and allows me to play around just as well. Because of this, I was able to save some money in the lens department.</span></p>
