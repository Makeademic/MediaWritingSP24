								<h3><em><span>Growing up in the Water</span></em></h3>
<p><strong><span>Have you ever dazed off on a cold winter day, reminiscing a memory of you playing in the cold ocean water on a bright sunny day? The ocean water waves make you think of a space in your brain that makes you feel a sense of happiness from when you are young to when you grow old. You may remember the first time you played around and splashed in a tub, ocean, or pool when you were younger. The feeling of the water wrapped around you and the sound the</span> splashes<span> made. Then, you were able to walk and began </span>collecting<span> water in your bucket and creating sandcastles on the beach. You may have even become more confident in the water and began to race your friends on your boogie board, riding the waves onto the shore. Think about it, you may have played with water before knowing how to walk or talk.</span></strong></p>
<h3><i><span>Fun with Water Sports</span></i></h3>
<p><span>We have so many different types of water sports that allow us to bring out our inner child self and make us want to play. As we continue to grow up, playing around in the water may look a little different in terms of speed and danger as opposed to when you were a child. As an adult, you have the opportunity to drive a boat, ride on a jet ski, water ski, or even scuba dive into the deep seas. The exhilarating feeling you get is like no other. I can remember that feeling that you get as you get sprayed with water, put on your life jacket, feel the wind on your face, and bake under the summer sun.</span></p>
<h3><i><span>Exploring in the Deep Seas</span></i></h3>
<p><span>When we were younger, we learned that exploring and creativity develop</span><span>&nbsp;from play. As mentioned in </span><i><span>The Power of Play: How Fun and Games Help Children Thrive, “</span></i><span>Research shows play can improve children's abilities to plan, organize, get along with others, and regulate emotions.” </span><span>Being able to search in the open oceans opens a whole new world for us living on land. We have the opportunity to dive into the deep seas and play with our gopros devices to learn about what is living and found under the surface. In an interview with a marine biologist named Sandra Schleier, she shared that “</span><span>embracing diving as a part of my life and it has changed it for the better, it is where I recharge my energy, where I have fun, and where I satisfy my curiosity.”</span><span> Isn’t it incredible that we get to learn more about the habitats and animals that live in the sea through our engagement in the water?</span></p>
<h3><i><span>Benefits from Play in the Water</span></i></h3>
<p><span>As both a child and an adult, you may find the</span><strong> sounds</strong><span> and images of the waves very tranquil. I find that even to this day, I use the ocean sound sleep sound machine to help me sleep. As found through a sleep doctor survey, “52% of surveyed adults say they rely on background noise to sleep,” As an adult, nothing feels better than l</span><span>ying on a raft or floating in the water. This has become a way to enjoy ourselves, and it usually makes us think about a getaway away from the stresses of school or work.</span><span> Furthermore, research from the article </span><i><span>5 Mental Benefits of Swi</span></i><i><span>mming: Feeling Good From the Water</span></i><span> found that<i> “because our body is made up of 70% water, our brains immediately feel at peace and have a positive response when we are in the</i></span><span>&nbsp;water.</span><span>” </span><span>Being able to express ourselves in the water truly allows us to have freedom and release stress. Your body feels so light in the water, and it allows you to have a moment where you feel invincible in the light water.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><em><span>Fun in the Sun&nbsp;</span></em></h3>
<p><span>Through and through, the saying “having fun in the sun” completely explains what a picture-perfect summer day would be at the beach, pool, or even a lake. All of the hype and fun are surrounded by bodies of water. Remember that play does not always have to be for children. Engaging in play in the water, allows us to ultimately have a good time and make forever memories that last a lifetime. A great day at the beach is never something you forget, no matter what age you are. Play essentially can be different for everyone, but no matter how you decide to engage in play on the beach, remember to have fun because that is what it is all about!</span></p>
