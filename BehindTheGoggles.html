<h3><span>Go deeper with a college lacrosse player on the reality and truths of playing at the next level.&nbsp;</span></h3>

								<p><img src="images/MM.jpeg" alt="lacrosse"></p>
								
<p><span>Pictured above is myself playing in a game against Lee University on 03/11/2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>The Recruitment Process&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>Growing up in a&nbsp;competitive household and with parents who were&nbsp;</span>athletes, it was no surprise that my sisters and I would become athletes ourselves. I started playing soccer when I was three years old and picked up lacrosse when I was in fifth grade. I continued both sports until my senior year of high school when I made the decision to continue playing lacrosse in college. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life career wise, (I still don't), but I always knew I wanted to play a sport in college.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recruiting process is difficult. You are selling yourself to these coaches at university's and have to perform your best at every game because that could be your only chance of being seen. You have to write emails, and emails, and emails. It is like you are constantly texting someone who never responds back and you just keep blowing up their phone. But, you have to be persistent so this is actually normal, which seems weird.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have coaches reaching out, you then have to figure out what school and team is the best fit for you. Advice I would give to those during this process is don't go to a school just for the coach or just because it is Division I. You want to like the school by itself without your sport in the picture because you never know what could happen. Your coach could leave, you could get injured, you could end up hating the sport and wanting to quit. You want to make sure that if your sport fails you in some way, you still love where you are.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Transition from High School to College</h4>
<p>College sports is a different ball game than high school sports. First day of practice can be a rude awakening for some freshman. You are back at the bottom and have to earn your spot and re define your name. You leave a community where you are the best of the best and enter a new community where everyone was the best of the best at some point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The competitiveness is different and the girls are definitely bigger, stronger, and faster. The girls are your friends, but on the field, you have to treat them like your opponent and people aren't afraid to push you to the ground or beat you in a drill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, two of my older sisters played lacrosse in college so I had some idea of what it would be like and what to expect, but there still were surprises. One of the biggest things I noticed from my class and incoming freshman each year is people underestimate how important it is to be in shape. You run a lot. A lot. Some schools are different but my team, we are on the end line very often. So with this, make sure you are in shape before the start of your season. Trust me.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Life Lessons&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Being an athlete you have to be tough, you have to work harder than anyone else and you have to keep pushing. I have learned so much from playing sports and I think being an athlete you have an advantage over those who aren't. There are so many life lessons you learn that will help in the real world such as time management, teamwork, perseverance, failure, success, being told no, and so much more.&nbsp;You are held to such a high standard with multiple responsibilities.</p>
<p>Although I am grateful for this, it does not mean it isn't challenging at the same time. Now a days, discussions of mental health are becoming more normalized.</p>
<h4>Mental Health Toll&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Being a collegiate student athlete definitely takes a toll on your mental and emotional stability. Coaches will play mind games and say one thing and their actions say another. You are constantly trying to do your best but some times you feel as if you keep being teared down over and over again.</p>
<p>It is draining. Every day can feel like the same day. You get in this routine and you almost lose track of time. You see the same 40 plus people everyday. It can be difficult to get the space that you need. Not to mention you are on a team full of girls and with girls, there is always drama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each team dynamic is different from the next. Some teams are a family and everyone gets along for the most part, but then there are teams that are cliquey. I struggled my freshman year with this.</p>
<p>The girls in my grade were not the nicest towards me and some of the others in our graduating class. It is the catty high school crap that you think will leave once you enter college, but some just do not mature. I'm talking, two girls looking at you, whispering to each other, looking back at you, and then laughing. It is not the greatest feeling to be excluded and outcasted. And it is even a worse feeling when you then have to see them every day at practice and see how fake they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There also are the body image issues that correlate to mental health. Having to fuel your body to perform well, but then some may feel guilty for eating such foods. Having to do certain workouts to stay in lacrosse shape, but those workouts don't necessarily work for the shape you want your body to look like.</p>
<p>Everyone deals with their own mental struggles and have their own struggles that may be different or similar to others.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Yin and Yang&nbsp;</h4>
<p>All in all, there will always be positives and negatives towards being a student athlete. I think some people try it and see it isn't the right fit for them and others finish all the way through. Everyone has their own experiences and opinion. I am happy I decided to play a college sport. I have been through one of the worst experiences in my life, and came out on the other side. I have met some of my best friends and have learned the value of trusting people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything that has happened in my journey so far has happened for a reason. Each obstacle has led me to a lesson and some I still have not gotten answers to yet. I would encourage people to pursue their sport in college, but to make sure it truly is the right fit for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
