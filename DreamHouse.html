<h4><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Barbie and her friends saving the world from the Kens</em></span></h4>
<h4><strong>The Evolution of Girlhood With Barbie&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Growing up, all little girls wanted to play with were Barbies. &nbsp;Barbies have such an impactful presence within my generation as well as previous ones. &nbsp;Blonde, ambitious, and powerful are three words that I would describe the dolls that were made to inspire young girls. &nbsp;Different Barbies were made to ambulate different types of jobs that girls could look up to and eventually do. &nbsp;In 1959, Barbies made their debut to the public in black and white bathing suits. &nbsp;The maker knew that Barbie was much more than just a woman in a bathing suit, but an inspiration to many which is why she was eventually transformed into a hardworking woman. &nbsp;When you think of Barbie, you also think of Ken and how he is supposed to compliment Barbie. During the time period of when this toy came out, women were thought of to be nothing more than a pretty face for their men. &nbsp;The idea of Barbie challenges that and proves that women are much more than what they used to be thought of. &nbsp;This inspires young girls to grow up with dreams and passions instead of stereotypes. &nbsp;When I was younger, I looked up to Barbie because she inspired me to be what I want in life and to always follow my dreams. &nbsp;Every time my friends and I hangout we would always play with our Barbies. &nbsp;I believe that she shaped us into the women we are today. &nbsp;There are so many different Barbies so when little girls go to the store they can choose the one that really signifies them and what their dreams are. &nbsp;Now that the new movie aired in theaters, I think that Barbie has became so much more relevant in younger generations. &nbsp;I genuinely hope that all girls and boys can grow up knowing that women can do anything I they out their minds to it. &nbsp;Even though Barbie is just a doll, she is actually so much more than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Playtime on Screen&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Yes, there have been movies made about the stories of Barbie but not about ACTUAL Barbie and her meaning until recently. &nbsp;When the new movie about what Barbie really means came out, I spent my own money five times to see it over and over again because that's how good it was. &nbsp;The director and screen writer did and amazing job showcasing what its like to be a women through none other than Barbie. Instead of telling a story of one of Barbies adventures, they drive into the deep meaning of the struggle of being a women in the real world compared to the Barbie world. &nbsp;Barbie is seen to be a perfect and beautiful women but in reality she expresses her insecurities throughout the movie. &nbsp;In Barbie world, women run it and are seen to be superior but it is shown that in the real world it is the complete opposite. &nbsp;It is true that at least in America, women are looked down upon and this movie really highlights the privilege that men have over women. &nbsp;Strong themes of friendship, empowerment, and self discovery is heavily seen throughout the film. &nbsp;She discovers her real purpose and accepts her individuality as a women aside from the men. &nbsp;This film encourages viewers to dream big just like Barbie and the cast did. &nbsp;During the film, Barbie goes to the real world and sees that it is the complete opposite of Barbie World. &nbsp;She goes on a journey to find a little girl named Sasha who lost her faith in Barbie so she can restore her dreams. &nbsp;On her way to finding the girl, she realizes that the real person she needs to find is the little girls mom who's name is Gloria. &nbsp;In one of the scenes where Barbie, Gloria, and Sasha are trying to save Barbie World from the Kens taking it over, Gloria explains to the women that they will never be "good enough" for men. &nbsp;Instead of trying to prove themselves to the Kens they need to follow their own dreams and realize they are okay without men in their lives. &nbsp;When viewers watch this movie they are able to also understand that they are strong and able to accomplish the sam goals that men can. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>While little girls grow up playing with Barbies in todays society, the women who have already grown up with the are able to watch a movie that has a much deeper meaning. &nbsp;As I watched the ending scenes of this powerful movie, I finally understood what it means to be a women. &nbsp;Being a women is not about beauty standards or proving yourself to men, it's about taking charge of your own life and being yourself. &nbsp;This is just another lesson that Barbie has taught us even now, all grown up. &nbsp;</p>
