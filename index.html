<p><span>Growing up in a&nbsp;competitive household and with parents who were&nbsp;</span>athletes, it was no surprise that my sisters and I would become athletes ourselves. I started playing soccer when I was three years old and picked up lacrosse when I was in fifth grade. I continued both sports until my senior year of high school when I made the decision to continue playing lacrosse in college. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life career wise, (I still don't), but I always knew I wanted to play a sport in college.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Growing up, all little girls wanted to play with were Barbies. &nbsp;Barbies have such an impactful presence within my generation as well as previous ones. &nbsp;Blonde, ambitious, and powerful are three words that I would describe the dolls that were made to inspire young girls. &nbsp;Different Barbies were made to ambulate different types of jobs that girls could look up to and eventually do. &nbsp;In 1959, Barbies made their debut to the public in black and white bathing suits. &nbsp;The maker knew that Barbie was much more than just a woman in a bathing suit, but an inspiration to many which is why she was eventually transformed into a hardworking woman. &nbsp;When you think of Barbie, you also think of Ken and how he is supposed to compliment Barbie. During the time period of when this toy came out, women were thought of to be nothing more than a pretty face for their men. &nbsp;The idea of Barbie challenges that and proves that women are much more than what they used to be thought of. &nbsp;This inspires young girls to grow up with dreams and passions instead of stereotypes. &nbsp;When I was younger, I looked up to Barbie because she inspired me to be what I want in life and to always follow my dreams. &nbsp;Every time my friends and I hangout we would always play with our Barbies. &nbsp;I believe that she shaped us into the women we are today. &nbsp;There are so many different Barbies so when little girls go to the store they can choose the one that really signifies them and what their dreams are. &nbsp;Now that the new movie aired in theaters, I think that Barbie has became so much more relevant in younger generations. &nbsp;I genuinely hope that all girls and boys can grow up knowing that women can do anything I they out their minds to it. &nbsp;Even though Barbie is just a doll, she is actually so much more than that.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I just recently visited Oahu, Hawaii and it was one of my favorite places that I've visited. I did a lot of research prior to my trip to ensure I knew all the best food spots, excursions, activities, and hiking spots on the island. Oahu is the perfect vacation spot and now that I have been, here's all the spots I would recommend checking out if you are planning on visiting this beautiful island. #AlohaOahu&nbsp;</span></p>
